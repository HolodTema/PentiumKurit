#Timer development diary
  Timer0.0.7 - I think, it will be the release version of Timer, because development of this app was too hard. I wanted to use ForegroundService or IntentService with beautiful Notification, but I've got some problems with Activity lifecycle. So, I made Timer0.0.7 without difficult stuff, but I added the function of choosing ringtone. I added apk file of Timer0.0.7 to this repository.
